# Object Browser Testing Guide

## Testing the New Object Browser Feature

The object browser is implemented in the `feature/object-browser` branch and provides vim-peekaboo style R workspace inspection.

### Quick Start Testing

1. **Switch to feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/object-browser
   ```

2. **Open test file:**
   ```bash
   vim test_files/object_browser_demo.R
   ```

3. **Start R terminal:**
   - Press `<LocalLeader>r` (usually `\r`)

4. **Create test objects:**
   - Execute the demo script with `<CR>` on various lines
   - Or select all and execute with visual mode + `<CR>`

5. **Open object browser:**
   - Press `<LocalLeader>"` (usually `\"`)
   - Should see right panel with object list

### Expected Behavior

#### **Browser Window:**
- Opens as 40-column vertical split on right
- Shows numbered list of R objects with types
- Objects display as: `1. object_name (type dimensions)`
- Clean, uncluttered interface

#### **Navigation:**
- **Number keys 1-9**: Quick inspect specific objects
- **Arrow keys + `<CR>`**: Navigate and inspect at cursor
- **ESC**: Return to object list (from detail view)
- **q**: Close browser entirely

#### **Object Inspection:**
- **Data frames**: Structure + head() preview
- **Vectors**: First/last elements if long
- **Models**: Summary statistics
- **Lists**: Nested structure display
- **Functions**: Class and basic info

### Test Cases

#### **1. Basic Functionality**
```r
# Create simple objects
x <- 1:10
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])

# Test browser:
# - Press <LocalLeader>" 
# - Should see both objects listed
# - Press 1 to inspect x
# - Press 2 to inspect df
```

#### **2. Navigation Flow**
```r
# Test navigation:
# - Open browser with <LocalLeader>"
# - Press 1 (should show object details)
# - Press ESC (should return to object list)
# - Press q (should close browser)
# - Press <LocalLeader>" again (should reopen)
```

#### **3. Different Object Types**
```r
# Create variety:
vec <- 1:100                    # Long vector
mat <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4)      # Matrix
lst <- list(a = 1:3, b = "hi") # List
mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)    # Model

# Test each type shows appropriate details
```

#### **4. Error Handling**
```r
# Test edge cases:
# - Open browser with no R terminal (should show error)
# - Open browser with empty workspace
# - Try browser in non-R file (should show error)
```

### Performance Testing

#### **Large Workspace:**
```r
# Create many objects:
for(i in 1:20) {
  assign(paste0("obj_", i), rnorm(100))
}

# Browser should:
# - Load quickly
# - Show all objects
# - Navigate smoothly
```

#### **Complex Objects:**
```r
# Create complex nested structures:
complex <- list(
  data = data.frame(matrix(rnorm(10000), 100, 100)),
  models = list(
    lm1 = lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars),
    lm2 = lm(mpg ~ hp, mtcars)
  ),
  metadata = list(
    created = Sys.time(),
    version = R.version.string
  )
)

# Should handle gracefully without hanging
```

### Integration Testing

#### **Multi-Terminal Workflow:**
```r
# Test with multiple R files:
# 1. Open file1.R, create objects, open browser
# 2. Open file2.R in new split, create different objects
# 3. Each browser should show only its buffer's objects
```

#### **Existing Functionality:**
```r
# Verify browser doesn't break existing features:
# - <CR> smart submission still works
# - <LocalLeader>h/s/d object inspection still works
# - Chunk navigation in Rmd files still works
```

### Troubleshooting

#### **Common Issues:**

1. **Browser doesn't open:**
   - Check you're in R file (`set ft=r`)
   - Verify R terminal exists (`<LocalLeader>r`)
   - Try Ex command: `:RObjectBrowser`

2. **Empty object list:**
   - Check R workspace has objects (`ls()` in R)
   - Verify terminal is active
   - Wait a moment and try refreshing

3. **Navigation not working:**
   - Ensure cursor is in browser window
   - Try number keys 1-9
   - Check buffer-local mappings are active

#### **Debug Commands:**
```vim
" Check if function exists:
:echo exists('*s:RObjectBrowser')

" Check terminal association:
:RShowTerminal

" Manual browser call:
:RObjectBrowser
```

### Success Criteria

âœ… **Feature is ready for merge when:**
- Browser opens instantly with `<LocalLeader>"`
- Shows all workspace objects with correct types
- Number key navigation works smoothly
- ESC/q close behavior works properly
- No conflicts with existing functionality
- Works across different R file types (R, Rmd, Qmd)
- Handles empty workspace gracefully
- Error messages are clear and helpful

### Rollback Plan

If issues are found:
```bash
# Return to master:
git checkout master

# Delete feature branch:
git branch -D feature/object-browser

# Or keep for later fixes:
git checkout feature/object-browser
# Make fixes and re-test
```

The object browser represents a significant enhancement to zzvim-R's capabilities, bringing modern IDE-style object inspection to the Vim environment while maintaining the plugin's lightweight, terminal-based philosophy.
