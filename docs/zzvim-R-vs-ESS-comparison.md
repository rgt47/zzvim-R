  filter(!is.na(outcome), treatment %in% c("A", "B", "Control")) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = cut(age, breaks = c(0, 30, 50, 70, 100), 
                    labels = c("Young", "Middle", "Mature", "Senior")),
    baseline_adjusted = outcome - baseline_score
  )

# Statistical modeling
model_basic <- lm(baseline_adjusted ~ treatment + age_group + gender, 
                  data = research_data)
model_interaction <- lm(baseline_adjusted ~ treatment * age_group + gender, 
                       data = research_data)
model_glm <- glm(response_binary ~ treatment + age_group, 
                 data = research_data, family = binomial)
