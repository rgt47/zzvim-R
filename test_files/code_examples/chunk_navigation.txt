# Chunk Navigation Logic Explanation

The most critical improvements in zzvim-R 2.3.0 were to the chunk navigation functions. Here's a detailed explanation of the fixed chunk navigation logic:

## Previous Issues

The original code in zzvim_r#navigate_prev_chunk() had several issues:

1. It was using pattern strings as line numbers with setpos()
2. It wasn't actually searching for the patterns
3. It didn't correctly handle being inside a chunk

## Fixed Navigation Logic

The improved navigation functions follow this logical sequence:

### For navigate_next_chunk:

1. Save current cursor position for potential restoration
2. Find if we're currently inside a chunk by searching backward for a chunk start pattern
3. If we're inside or at the start of a chunk, move to the start of the chunk and then advance one line
4. Search forward for the next chunk start pattern
5. If found, move to the first line of content in the chunk (one line after the header)
6. If not found, restore the original cursor position and show a warning

### For navigate_prev_chunk:

1. Save current cursor position for potential restoration
2. Find if we're currently inside a chunk by searching backward for a chunk start pattern
3. If we're inside a chunk:
   a. Move to the start of the current chunk
   b. If not already at the chunk start, go to it
   c. Move above the current chunk to search for the previous one
4. Search backward for the previous chunk start pattern
5. If found, move to the first line of content in the chunk (one line after the header)
6. If not found, restore the original cursor position and show a warning

## Key Implementation Details

1. Use of search flags:
   - 'b' for backward search
   - 'W' to not wrap around the end of the file
   - 'c' to accept current position
   - 'n' to not move the cursor during initial checks

2. Cursor positioning:
   - Use cursor() for line/column positioning
   - Use setpos() for restoring saved positions
   - Add 'zz' to center the display on the new position

3. Error handling:
   - Save position before any navigation
   - Restore position if navigation fails
   - Show informative messages about what happened

This improved implementation ensures reliable navigation between chunks in R Markdown files, addressing the primary issues users were experiencing with the plugin.
