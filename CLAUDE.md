## Architecture & Design Patterns

The plugin uses a simple, single-file architecture with clear functional separation:

### **Current Architecture (Single File)**

**plugin/zzvim-R.vim** contains all functionality organized into logical sections:

1. **Configuration Management**: Global variables and settings
2. **Core Functions**: Terminal management, R communication
3. **Generalized SendToR System**: Smart pattern detection and text extraction
4. **Chunk Navigation**: R Markdown chunk handling
5. **Object Inspection**: R object examination functions
6. **Key Mappings**: Context-aware key bindings

### **Key Design Principles**

1. **Pattern-Based Intelligence**: Automatic detection of R code structures
2. **Consistent Temp File Approach**: All code submission uses temporary files
3. **Context-Aware Behavior**: `<CR>` key adapts to cursor position
4. **Error Handling**: Robust position restoration and error messaging
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserves existing function behavior

## Core Function Groups

### **1. Generalized SendToR System**
- **`s:SendToR(selection_type)`**: Main dispatcher for all code submission
- **`s:GetTextByType(selection_type)`**: Smart text extraction with auto-detection
- **`s:IsBlockStart(line)`**: Pattern matching for code block detection
- **`s:GetCodeBlock()`**: Brace matching algorithm for complete blocks

### **2. Text Extraction Functions**
- **`s:GetVisualSelectionLines()`**: Extract visual selection as lines

- **Built-in actions**: head, str, dim, print, names, length, glimpse, etc.

## Key Mappings System

The plugin provides an intelligent key mapping system with smart context detection:

### **Smart `<CR>` Behavior (Context-Aware)**

**Normal Mode**: `<CR>` calls `s:SmartSubmit()` which automatically detects:
- **Function definitions**: `my_func <- function(x) {` → sends entire function block
- **Control structures**: `if (condition) {`, `for (i in 1:10) {` → sends entire block
- **Regular lines**: `x <- 5` → sends current line only
- **Lines inside functions**: Individual line execution for debugging

**Visual Mode**: `<CR>` → sends visual selection to R

### **Multi-Terminal Management Operations**
- **`<LocalLeader>r`**: Create buffer-specific R terminal (replaces current window)
- **`<LocalLeader>w`**: Open R terminal in new vertical split window
- **`<LocalLeader>W`**: Open R terminal in new horizontal split window
- **`<CR>`**: Smart submission (context-aware, silent execution)

### **Chunk Navigation**
- **`<LocalLeader>j`**: Next chunk
- **`<LocalLeader>k`**: Previous chunk
- **`<LocalLeader>l`**: Execute current chunk (buffer-specific terminal)
- **`<LocalLeader>t`**: Execute all previous chunks (buffer-specific terminal)

### **Object Inspection (Single-Letter)**
- **`<LocalLeader>h`**: head()
- **`<LocalLeader>s`**: str()
- **`<LocalLeader>d`**: dim()
- **`<LocalLeader>p`**: print()
- **`<LocalLeader>n`**: names()
- **`<LocalLeader>f`**: length()
- **`<LocalLeader>g`**: glimpse()
- **`<LocalLeader>b`**: dt (data.table print)
- **`<LocalLeader>u`**: tail()
- **`<LocalLeader>y`**: help()

### **Control Keys**
- **`<LocalLeader>q`**: Send Q to R (quit buffer-specific session)
- **`<LocalLeader>c`**: Send Ctrl-C to R (interrupt buffer-specific session)

### **Generalized Send Functions (Advanced)**
- **`<LocalLeader>sf`**: Force send function block
- **`<LocalLeader>sl`**: Force send current line only
- **`<LocalLeader>sa`**: Smart auto-detection (same as `<CR>`)

### **Other Operations**
- **`<LocalLeader>o`**: Add pipe operator (`%>%`) and new line

## Development History

### Version 2.3.0 (Key Mapping & Navigation Fixes)

In version 2.3.0, two major issues were fixed:

1. **Chunk Navigation Fix**: The `navigate_prev_chunk()` function was completely rewritten to fix several critical issues:
   - Original function incorrectly used pattern strings as line numbers with `setpos()`
   - No actual pattern searching was performed
   - The function didn't consider the cursor's context
   - The fixed implementation properly uses `search()`, handles cursor context, and preserves position

2. **Key Mapping Conflict Resolution**: Changed prefixes for two-letter mappings to eliminate conflicts with single-letter mappings:
   - Package management: `pi/pl/pu` → `xi/xl/xu`
   - Data operations: `dr/dw/dl/ds` → `zr/zw/zl/zs`
   - Directory operations: `pd/cd/ld/hd` → `vd/vc/vl/vh`
   - Help functions: `he/ha/hf` → `ue/ua/uf`

### Version 2.3.1 & 2.3.2 (Code Quality Improvements)

These versions focused on code quality and architecture:

## Code Examples & Patterns

### Generalized SendToR Pattern

```vim
function! s:SendToR(selection_type, ...) abort
    " Get text lines based on selection type or smart detection
    let text_lines = s:GetTextByType(a:selection_type)
    
    if empty(text_lines)
        call s:Error("No text to send to R.")
        return
    endif
    
    " Always use temp file approach for consistency
    let temp_file = tempname()
    call writefile(text_lines, temp_file)
    let cmd = "source('" . temp_file . "', echo=T)\n"
    call s:Send_to_r(cmd, 0)
    
    " Provide feedback about what was sent
    let line_count = len(text_lines)
    echom "Sent " . line_count . " lines to R."
endfunction
```

### Smart Detection Pattern

```vim
function! s:IsBlockStart(line) abort
    " Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    let clean_line = substitute(a:line, '^\s\+\|\s\+$', '', 'g')
    
    " Check each pattern individually
    if clean_line =~# '.*function\s*('
        return 1
    endif
    if clean_line =~# '^\s*if\s*('
        return 1
    endif
    if clean_line =~# '^\s*for\s*('
        return 1
    endif
    " ... more patterns ...
    
    return 0
endfunction
```

### Brace Matching Algorithm

```vim
function! s:GetCodeBlock() abort
    let save_pos = getpos('.')
    let current_line_num = line('.')
    
    " Find the opening brace
    let brace_line = current_line_num
    let found_opening = 0
    
    while brace_line <= line('$')
        let line_content = getline(brace_line)
        if line_content =~ '{'
            let found_opening = 1
            break
        endif
        let brace_line += 1
        if brace_line > current_line_num + 5
            break
        endif
    endwhile
    
    " Find matching closing brace using brace counting
    let brace_count = 0
    let end_line = -1
    
    for line_num in range(brace_line, line('$'))
        let line_content = getline(line_num)
        let open_braces = len(substitute(line_content, '[^{]', '', 'g'))
        let close_braces = len(substitute(line_content, '[^}]', '', 'g'))
        let brace_count += open_braces - close_braces
        
        if brace_count == 0 && (open_braces > 0 || close_braces > 0)
            let end_line = line_num
            break
        endif
    endfor
    
    call setpos('.', save_pos)
    return getline(current_line_num, end_line)
endfunction
```

### Smart Submission Wrapper

```vim
function! s:SmartSubmit() abort
    " Use smart detection (empty string triggers auto-detection)
    call s:SendToR('')
endfunction
```

## Common Development Patterns

1. **Pattern-Based Detection**: Use regex patterns to identify R code structures
2. **Position Preservation**: Always save and restore cursor position in navigation functions
3. **Temp File Approach**: Use temporary files for all R code submission to handle size limits
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and restore state on failure
5. **Brace Counting**: Use proper brace matching algorithms for nested structures
6. **Context Awareness**: Functions should adapt behavior based on cursor location
7. **Return Values**: Use integers (0/1) consistently for success/failure
8. **Script-Local Functions**: Keep internal functions private with `s:` prefix

## Key Issue Fixes

### Character Limit Issue Resolution

**Problem**: R terminals and Vim's terminal communication have character/line limits that caused issues with large functions or chunks.

**Solution**: Implemented unified temp file approach:
```vim
let temp_file = tempname()
call writefile(text_lines, temp_file)
let cmd = "source('" . temp_file . "', echo=T)\n"
call s:Send_to_r(cmd, 0)
```

**Benefits**:
- Works for any size selection
- Consistent behavior across all submission types
- No character limits
- R's `source()` with `echo=T` shows executed code

### Smart Code Detection Implementation

**Problem**: Users had to manually specify whether to send a line, function, or code block.

**Solution**: Implemented pattern-based detection system:

```vim
function! s:IsBlockStart(line) abort
    " Detects: function(), if(), for(), while(), repeat{}, {}
    if clean_line =~# '.*function\s*('
        return 1
    endif
    " ... more patterns
endfunction
```

**Key Benefits**:
- `<CR>` automatically detects context
- Function definitions → send entire function
- Control structures → send entire block  
- Regular lines → send individual line
- Lines inside functions → individual execution for debugging

### Brace Matching Algorithm

**Problem**: Accurately finding the end of R code blocks with nested braces.

**Solution**: Implemented robust brace counting:

```vim
let brace_count = 0
for line_num in range(brace_line, line('$'))
    let open_braces = len(substitute(line_content, '[^{]', '', 'g'))
    let close_braces = len(substitute(line_content, '[^}]', '', 'g'))
    let brace_count += open_braces - close_braces
    
    if brace_count == 0 && (open_braces > 0 || close_braces > 0)
        let end_line = line_num
        break
    endif
endfor
```

**Handles**:
- Nested functions and control structures
- Multiple braces on same line
- Complex R code patterns

## Vim-Specific Implementation Notes

1. **Single File Architecture**: All functionality contained in plugin/zzvim-R.vim
2. **Script-Local Functions**: Functions prefixed with `s:` are only accessible within their script
3. **Terminal Management**: Uses Vim's built-in terminal features
4. **Variable Scoping**:
   - `g:` Global variables (configuration)
   - `s:` Script-local variables
   - `l:` Function-local variables
   - `a:` Function argument variables
5. **Pattern Matching**: Uses Vim's regex engine with `=~#` for case-sensitive matching
6. **Position Management**: Uses `getpos()` and `setpos()` for cursor position handling
7. **Key Mapping**: Uses autocmd with FileType to create filetype-specific mappings

## Working with the Current Codebase

When modifying this plugin:

1. **Test Files**: Use test_files/ for testing changes, especially:
   - `test_generalized_send.R` - Test smart detection patterns
   - `new_functionality_demo.R` - Demo various use cases
2. **Pattern Testing**: Test new patterns in `s:IsBlockStart()` thoroughly
3. **Position Preservation**: Always save/restore cursor position in navigation functions
4. **Temp File Approach**: Maintain consistency with temp file method for R submission
5. **Error Handling**: Include proper error messages and state restoration
6. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md when adding significant functionality

## Testing Process

Focus on these key areas when testing:

1. **Smart Detection**: Test pattern recognition on various R code structures
2. **Brace Matching**: Verify correct code block extraction with nested structures  
3. **Context Awareness**: Test `<CR>` behavior in different cursor positions
4. **Terminal Integration**: Verify R terminal creation and code submission
5. **Chunk Navigation**: Test R Markdown chunk handling
6. **Error Scenarios**: Test behavior with malformed code and missing braces
7. **File Type Support**: Test with R, RMD, QMD files

## Current Capabilities & Limitations

## Clean Execution System Implementation (August 18, 2025)

### **Major Terminal Experience Enhancement**

#### **Complete Source Command Elimination**
- **Problem Identified**: All code execution was showing cluttered `source('/var/folders/.../temp123', echo=T)` commands in R terminal
- **Comprehensive Solution**: Implemented intelligent code transmission system eliminating temp file visibility across ALL execution methods

#### **Technical Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Object Browser Optimization** (Phase 1):
   - Replaced temp file + source() approach with compact single-line R commands
   - Workspace overview: `{cat("\n=== Workspace ===\n");for(o in ls())cat(o,":",class(get(o))[1],"\n");cat("=================\n")}`
   - Object inspection: `{cat("\n=== obj ===\n");if(exists("obj"))glimpse(obj) else str(obj)}`
   - Result: Clean object browser with no command clutter

2. **Main Code Execution System Overhaul** (Phase 2):
   - **Single Lines**: Direct transmission (no temp files, no source commands)
   - **Small Blocks (≤5 lines)**: Line-by-line with brief delays (preserves formatting)
   - **Large Blocks (>5 lines)**: Minimal `source("file",F)` format (no echo parameter)
   - Applied to ALL execution methods: `<CR>`, `<LocalLeader>l`, chunks, visual selection

#### **User Experience Transformation**:

**Before (cluttered terminal):**
```bash
> source('/var/folders/c2/7xx2n4d92k7_4btgk8gt3gs00000gn/T/vlmBhM4/1', echo=T)
> library(dplyr)
> 
> source('/var/folders/c2/7xx2n4d92k7_4btgk8gt3gs00000gn/T/vlmBhM4/2', echo=T)
> aa <- head(iris)
```

**After (professional output):**
```bash
> library(dplyr)
> aa <- head(iris)
```

#### **Comprehensive Impact**:

**All Execution Methods Cleaned:**
- ✅ Smart code submission (`<CR>`) - now direct/line-by-line
- ✅ Chunk execution (`<LocalLeader>l`) - clean transmission
- ✅ Previous chunks (`<LocalLeader>t`) - minimal format
- ✅ Visual selection - direct code transmission
- ✅ Object browser (`<LocalLeader>'`, `<LocalLeader>i`) - compact expressions
- ✅ All Ex commands - professional terminal output

**Documentation & Quality Improvements:**
- Fixed broken key mappings (`<localleader>l` and `<localleader>t`)
- Corrected command documentation inaccuracies (`:RSubmitLine` → `:RSendLine`)
- Added missing command documentation (`:RInstallDplyr`)
- Improved line wrapping compliance (76-character limit)
- Created comprehensive test suite for clean execution validation

#### **Technical Benefits**:
- **Performance**: Reduced disk I/O for most code execution
- **Reliability**: Maintains all functionality while improving presentation
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with appropriate handling for different code sizes
- **User Experience**: Professional terminal appearance matching commercial IDEs

- `test_usage_simulation.vim` - User workflow simulation
- Comprehensive manual testing checklist for all execution types

**Strategic Outcome**: Transformed zzvim-R from a functional but cluttered terminal experience into a **professional, clean development environment** that competes directly with commercial R IDEs in terms of presentation quality while maintaining its lightweight, fast architecture.

## Consistent Source Command Implementation (August 18, 2025 - Final)

### **System Refinement and Consistency Enhancement**

#### **Final Problem Resolution**
- **Issue Identified**: After implementing variable code execution methods, chunk execution still showed inconsistent source command formats
- **User Feedback**: Request for unified approach across all execution methods (lines, blocks, chunks)
- **Root Cause**: Mixed execution strategies created unpredictable terminal output

#### **Final Solution: Unified Temp File Approach**

**Technical Decision**: Revert to consistent temp file method for ALL code execution with optimized command format.

**Implementation Details:**
```vim
" Phase 2: Consistent Code Transmission with Suppressed Source Echo
" Use temp file approach for all code blocks for consistency
let temp_file = tempname()
call writefile(text_lines, temp_file)

" Use minimal source command format
call s:Send_to_r('source("' . temp_file . '")', 1)
```

#### **Terminal Output Transformation**:

**Before (inconsistent and verbose):**
```bash
> source('/var/folders/.../temp123', echo=T)    # Old verbose format
> source('/var/folders/.../temp456',F)          # Mixed parameters
> library(dplyr)                               # Direct transmission
```

**After (consistent and minimal):**
```bash
> source("/var/folders/.../temp123")            # Unified minimal format
> source("/var/folders/.../temp456")            # Consistent across all
```

#### **Consistency Benefits Achieved**:

1. **Predictable Behavior**: All execution methods use identical approach
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Single code path eliminates edge cases  
3. **Professional Appearance**: Consistent, minimal source command format
4. **Reliable Transmission**: Temp file approach handles all code complexity
5. **User Expectation**: Unified experience across all workflows

#### **Universal Application Verified**:
- ✅ **Single Lines**: `x <- 5` → `source("temp")` format
- ✅ **Function Blocks**: Multi-line functions → `source("temp")` format  
- ✅ **R Markdown Chunks**: `<LocalLeader>l` → `source("temp")` format
- ✅ **Visual Selections**: Custom selections → `source("temp")` format
- ✅ **All Ex Commands**: Consistent format across all commands

#### **Key Design Principles Applied**:
- **Consistency over Optimization**: Unified approach preferred over varied methods
- **Predictability over Cleverness**: Simple, reliable behavior for all cases
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean terminal output matching commercial tools
- **Maintainability**: Single execution path reduces complexity

#### **Final User Experience**:
When executing the first chunk in `ex.Rmd`:
```bash
> source("/var/folders/c2/7xx2n4d92k7_4btgk8gt3gs00000gn/T/vOhrbuT/1")
[conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::filter over any other package.
[conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::select over any other package.
[conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::summarize over any other package.
[conflicted] Will prefer data::penguins over any other package.
```

**Result**: Clean, professional terminal output with minimal command visibility and reliable code execution across all zzvim-R workflows.

**Final Assessment**: Successfully achieved **IDE-quality terminal presentation** while maintaining zzvim-R's core philosophy of lightweight, reliable R development tools.
